# OAS Quality Feedback Automation Plan
*Using GitHub Awesome Copilot Tooling for Issue #228819*

## Project Context
**Goal**: Automate providing feedback on pull requests about the health and quality of new OpenAPI specifications that are part of changes to the Kibana HTTP API layer.

**Current State Analysis** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**:
- Kibana has existing OAS infrastructure in `oas_docs/` with validation tools (Redocly, Spectral, Vacuum)
- CI/CD runs on Buildkite with existing `capture_oas_snapshot.sh` workflow
- OpenAPI bundles are generated for stateful and serverless variants
- Existing validation: `make api-docs-lint`, VS Code integration, and a CLI tool (`scripts/validate_oas_docs.js`) that runs `@kbn/validate-oas` from `src/platform/packages/private/kbn-validate-oas`
- **NEW**: Comprehensive API documentation guidelines with cumulative documentation approach and version-specific badging
- **KEY INSIGHT**: Solution should extend existing CLI tool rather than build new infrastructure
- Need: Automated PR feedback for OAS quality issues

**Project Progress Status as of August 21, 2025**: 
- üìã **Planning**: ‚úÖ 100% Complete (Parent issue #228819 + 11 sub-issues created)
- üîß **Design & Specifications**: ‚úÖ 100% Complete (Architecture + detailed Sprint 1 technical specs) 
- üíª **Implementation**: ‚úÖ 90% Complete (Sprint 1 NEARLY COMPLETE - Major functional code implemented)
- üìä **Monitoring**: ‚ùå 0% Complete (Future phase)

- Where in the CI pipeline should quality checks run, and how do they interact with documentation workflows?
- What existing tools (Spectral, Redocly, Vacuum, CLI) can be leveraged vs. new tools needed?
- How should feedback be presented to developers, including version-specific and cumulative documentation considerations?
- How do known linter issues (e.g., Spectral discriminator bug) affect validation and reporting?
