# PRD: OpenAPI Quality Feedback Automation for Kibana

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

* PRD: OpenAPI Quality Feedback Automation for Kibana
* Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

This project aims to automate quality feedback for OpenAPI specifications (OAS) in Kibana pull requests by integrating validation checks directly into the CI/CD pipeline. The system will analyze new or modified OAS files for quality issues such as missing descriptions, structural inconsistencies, and violations of Kibana's HTTP API guidelines, providing immediate, actionable feedback to developers through GitHub PR comments.

The solution builds upon Kibana's existing OAS infrastructure (`oas_docs/`, Redocly, Spectral) and Buildkite CI/CD pipeline to catch API documentation quality issues early in the development process. By automating what is currently a manual review process, the project will improve API documentation consistency, reduce reviewer burden, and accelerate the development workflow while maintaining high standards for Kibana's public APIs.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals

* Reduce manual review time for API documentation by 60% through automated quality checks
* Improve consistency across Kibana's public APIs by enforcing standardized validation rules

## 6. Narrative

When a Kibana developer modifies HTTP API code that affects OpenAPI specifications, they can immediately validate their changes using a local CLI tool that provides feedback within minutes. This enables developers to catch and fix quality issues during development before committing code. When the developer creates a pull request, the CI/CD pipeline automatically validates the OAS changes and posts comprehensive feedback as a GitHub comment within the typical 2-hour build cycle. This two-tiered approach ensures both rapid development iteration and thorough review validation, seamlessly integrating with Kibana's existing workflow while maintaining high API documentation standards.
