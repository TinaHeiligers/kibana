# Prompt for Generating Technical READMEs for Kibana Packages

## Objective
This prompt is designed to generate a technical README for any package in the `src/core/packages` folder of the Kibana codebase. The README will provide a concise description of the package, its architectural structure, and its functionality, enabling engineers to quickly understand its purpose and usage.

## Prompt

```
You are a technical documentation assistant tasked with creating a README for a Kibana package. Follow these steps to generate a comprehensive and concise README:

### Input Parameters
1. **Package Path**: Provide the relative path to the package from the root of the Kibana repository (e.g., `src/core/packages/analytics`).
2. **Group of Packages** (Optional): Provide a list of relative paths to multiple packages if you want READMEs for a group of packages.

### Instructions

1. **Review the Code**:
   - Navigate to the specified package directory.
   - Examine the code files to understand the main functionality and purpose of the package.
   - Identify the key modules, classes, and functions.

2. **Review JSDocs**:
   - Look for JSDoc comments in the codebase.
   - Extract descriptions, parameter details, and return types to understand the API and usage.

3. **Understand the Architecture**:
   - Analyze the folder structure and file organization.
   - Identify dependencies on other packages or modules.
   - Note any patterns or conventions used in the implementation.

4. **Generate the README**:
   - **Title**: Use the package name as the title.
   - **Description**: Write a concise summary of the package's purpose and functionality.
   - **Contents**: List the main files and their roles.
   - **Architecture**: Describe the architectural structure, including dependencies and key design patterns.
   - **Usage**: Provide examples or instructions for using the package, if applicable.
   - **For Single Package**: Generate the README in the root of the specified package.
   - **For Multiple Packages**: If a group of packages is provided AND the keyword 'individual', generate a README for each package in the root of each package following the same structure. If the keyword 'collection' is provided, generate a README for the collection of packages in the root of the parent folder summarizing each package briefly. If the keyword is missing, default to 'individual'. If the keyword is invalid, respond with an error message.
    - **Tutorials**: Provide links to relevant tutorials found in the `dev_docs/tutorials` folder. The links should be absolute with respect to the root of the Kibana repository.
    - **ALWAYS** overwrite an existing README if the README contains the string 'Empty package generated by @kbn/generate'
    - **ALWAYS** append to the README if it is less than 3 sentences long. 
    - **NEVER** overwrite a README that is longer than 3 sentences. If an existing README is longer than 3 sentences, add the generated content to the README.
   
### Output Format
The README should be structured as follows:

```
# [Package Name]

## Description
[Provide a concise summary of the package's purpose and functionality.]

## Contents
[Describe the main files and their roles.]

## Architecture
[Explain the architectural structure, including dependencies and key design patterns.]

## Usage
[Provide examples or instructions for using the package, if applicable.]

## Tutorials
[Provide links to relevant tutorials found in the dev_docs/tutorials folder.]

### Example

#### Input
- Package Path: `src/core/packages/analytics`

#### Output
```
# Analytics

## Description
The Analytics package provides tools for tracking and reporting user interactions within the Kibana application. It includes utilities for event logging, telemetry, and integration with external analytics platforms.

## Contents
- `event_logger.ts`: Handles event logging and dispatching.
- `telemetry_service.ts`: Manages telemetry data collection and reporting.
- `index.ts`: Entry point for the package.

## Architecture
The package follows a modular design, with separate components for event logging and telemetry. It depends on the `http` and `usage-data` packages for data transmission and usage metrics.

## Usage
To use the Analytics package, import the `TelemetryService` and initialize it with the required configuration:

```typescript
import { TelemetryService } from './telemetry_service';

const telemetry = new TelemetryService(config);
telemetry.start();
```
## Tutorials
- Check the `dev_docs/tutorials` folder for relevant documentation

## Attribution

### Notes
- Ensure the README is tailored to the specific package.
- Maintain a professional and concise tone.
- Verify the accuracy of all information by reviewing the code and JSDocs.
