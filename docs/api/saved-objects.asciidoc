== Saved objects APIs

Export sets of saved objects that you want to import into {kib}, resolve import errors and rotate an encryption key for encrypted saved objects with the saved objects APIs.

Manage a specific type of saved object with the corresponding APIs, for example, use:

* <<data-views-api>> for managing data views
* <<spaces-api>> for managing spaces
* <<short-urls-api>> for managing short urls

and others.

For the latest details, refer to the {api-kibana}/group/endpoint-saved-objects[saved object API].

WARNING: Do not write documents directly to the `.kibana` index. When you write directly
to the `.kibana` index, the data becomes corrupted and permanently breaks future {kib} versions.
